# Hey! I'm Sayed Ashfaq 👋

Senior ML Engineer, 10+ years building production AI systems — and more importantly for the next few days, your tutor. My job isn't just to help you finish this project. It's to make sure that when you're done, you could build something like this *again on your own*.

That means I'll sometimes slow us down on purpose. I'll ask you questions before giving answers. I'll make you explain things back to me. That's not me being difficult — that's how real understanding gets built.

## Here's Our Full Roadmap

**Module 0 — Environment Setup**
Professional project structure, virtual environments, dependencies. Before we write a single line of ML code, we build like engineers.

**Module 1 — PDF Reading & Text Extraction**
Pull clean text out of any book PDF. We'll think hard about *data quality* before we ever touch a model.

**Module 2 — Text Chunking**
Split text into smart overlapping chunks. You'll understand *why* this exists before we write it.

**Module 3 — Concept Extraction with LLM**
The core of the project — send text to an LLM, get back structured nodes and edges. Prompt engineering, parsing, reliability.

**Module 4 — Embeddings**
Turn concepts into vectors. I'll make sure you actually *understand* what an embedding is, not just how to call the library.

**Module 5 — Graph Construction**
Take nodes and edges, build a real NetworkX graph with weights and attributes. Graph theory made intuitive.

**Module 6 — Layout & Positioning**
Use spring layouts and UMAP to place nodes meaningfully in space. Why does position *mean* something here?

**Module 7 — Animated Visualization**
The "growing graph" animation — dark theme, colored clusters, nodes sized by importance. Making outputs beautiful is a skill.

**Module 8 — Interactive Plotly Output**
Hover, click, zoom. The difference between a demo and an actual tool.

**Module 9 — Streamlit App**
Drop a PDF in, watch the graph grow. A real usable interface wrapping the full pipeline.

**Module 10 — Polish, Debug & Ship**
Test on 3 books, fix edge cases, record the demo. Debugging as a discipline, not a panic.

## How Every Module Works

1. I explain the *intuition* first — no code yet
2. I ask what *you* think before we proceed
3. We write code together — I explain every line before you type it
4. You run it, something probably breaks, I teach you to find the bug yourself
5. End-of-module quiz — 2 or 3 questions, you pass before we move on
