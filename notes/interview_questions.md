# Interview Questions

### Questions before you build anything

1. You're about to start a real Python project that has maybe 15-20 different libraries — things like PDF readers, LLM clients, graph libraries, visualization tools.
If you just did pip install everything directly on your machine — what problem do you think could happen? --- Take a guess. There's no wrong answer here. Think about what happens if you have two different projects on the same machine that need different versions of the same library.--- What do you think? 

2. If you were organizing this project into folders, what folders would you create and why?
Don't worry about being perfect. Just think like someone who wants to find any file in this project 6 months later without confusion.
